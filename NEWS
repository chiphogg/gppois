CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2-0 (2012-07-16)

MAJOR CHANGES:

  * Upgraded to use the latest version of R (2.15.1); now requires >= 2.14.0 so
    NAMESPACE works correctly

  * All documentation now uses roxygen2 (previously, functions used roxygen2,
    but classes were documented with Rdoc from R.oo)

  * I have begun converting my old unit tests.  Package now does some unit
    testing, but it's presently incomplete

DEMOS:

  * Added 'flameSpeed' demo, to illustrate how to analyze data with this
    package.  Few datapoints, so it's fairly fast.

  * Another demo, 'steelStrain', is somewhat long (training can take upwards of
    10 minutes), but the pictures are pretty.

DATASETS:

  * Added three new datasets
    - simXrayAu2nm is simulated data from our JAC paper
    - xrayTiO2np20nm is experimental data from our JAC paper
    - flameSpeed is used for a simple demo

  * steelStrain now includes all three strain columns, as well as a separate
    data.frame with the "gap" datapoints

MINOR FEATURES:

  * Plot2D.Dataset: clearing previously-plotted material is now *optional*;
    pass clear=FALSE to prevent it

BUG FIXES:

  * getLower() and getUpper() now match positionally with getParams(), when
  * for.training is TRUE.  Model$Train() had been failing because of a defect
    in how optim() handles bounds for the L-BFGS-B method.
