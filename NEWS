gppois 0.2-0
===============================================================================

* Upgraded to use the latest version of R (2.15.1).

* All documentation now uses roxygen2 (previously, functions used roxygen2, but
  classes were documented with Rdoc from R.oo)

DEMOS
-----

* Made a demo for the steelStrain data, to get a feel for the package.  It's
  somewhat long (training can take upwards of 10 minutes), but the pictures are
  pretty.

DATASETS
--------

* steelStrain now includes all three strain columns, as well as a separate
  data.frame with the "gap" datapoints

* Added flameSpeed dataset

BUG FIXES
---------

* getLower() and getUpper() now match positionally with getParams(), when
  for.training is TRUE.  Model$Train() had been failing because of a defect in
  how optim() handles bounds for the L-BFGS-B method.
